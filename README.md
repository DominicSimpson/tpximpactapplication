## Part One: HTML / CSS

### For the first part of my application for TPXImpact, I completed a mock-up of a vintage graphic design poster in HTML and CSS. This was taken from a selection provided by TPXImpact of vintage European posters. My choice was the below:

### And here is my final attempt at a mock-up of the image:

### I gave the body a colour that approximated that of the poster as much as possible, ```rgb(248, 234, 216)```.
### I then created eighteen columns, each delineated in the HTML with its own column ID, and with each column containing three divs for the three colour elements, or 'sections', in each column. I then started applying the colours in CSS. It became obvious quickly that I would have to do quite a bit of work to replicate the gradient element effects that you can see in the colours in the original. But before that, I had to try and approximate the colours generally that you can see in the original image as much as possible. My own [colour picker](https://github.com/DominicSimpson/facprecolorpicker), which I completed as a pre-course task for Founders & Coders, was useful, as was [other online colour pickers](https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF). But ultimately, using the colour pallette built into Visual Studio Code when working on CSS colours, was just as helpful.
