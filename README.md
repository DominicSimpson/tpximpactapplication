### For the first part of my application for TPXImpact, I completed a mock-up of a vintage graphic design poster in HTML and CSS, taken from a selection provided by TPXImpact. My initial choice was this poster:

However, somewhat interestingly, after I applied the transform property to my nascent columns, I found that the purple and green columns, if designated in the CSS at rroughly half the length of the black columns, would automatically gain in size when I minimised the browser window, to the point where they equalled the size of the back columns. The below images should indicate what I mean.
